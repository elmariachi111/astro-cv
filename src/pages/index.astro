              Created out of a finalist project at EthOnline 21. Splice is a

              artworks using p5 algorithms that are stored on IPFS and NFTs
              themselves. Derivatives are limited, code style authors get paid
              when holders mint new pieces. Failed after remote team didn't want
              to take the risk
